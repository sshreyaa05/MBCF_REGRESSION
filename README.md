### MBCF Regression Model for Predicting Missing Ratings Using Linear Regression (OLS) and Decision Tree Regressor
### Overview: 
The MBCF Regression Model project aims to predict missing ratings in a recommendation system by leveraging two machine learning techniques: Linear Regression using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method and Decision Tree Regressor. Both methods were applied to a custom dataset to estimate the ratings that users had not yet provided. The goal was to evaluate the performance of these models in providing accurate recommendations.
### Result: 
Both the Linear Regression (OLS method) and Decision Tree Regressor models yielded identical results in terms of predicted ratings for the missing data. Despite the difference in model approaches—linear versus non-linear—both methods managed to produce the same recommendations.
### Conclusion: 
The findings indicate that both Linear Regression (OLS) and Decision Tree Regressor were equally effective in predicting the missing ratings for the given dataset. This suggests that for this specific problem, both models are viable options for recommendation systems, demonstrating the robustness of the regression methods in handling real-world data for accurate predictions.
